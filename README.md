# Mapping Earthquakes

This map gives the user the option to plot data:

1. All earthquakes in the last 7 days.
2. The plate tetontic boundaries.
3. Earthquakes greater than 4.5 in the last 7 days.

And allows the user to plot that data over 3 base maps:

1. Street map
2. Satellite map
3. Topographic map that shows elevation countours
